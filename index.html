            <h3>DESIGNED A HUB & SPOKE ARCHITECTURE IN AZURE</h3>
            <p> 
                A Hub-and-Spoke architecture is a common networking design pattern used in Azure and other cloud platforms to create a scalable, 
                efficient, and well-organized network infrastructure. In this architecture, a central hub serves as a primary point of connectivity 
                and control, while multiple spokes connect to the hub to communicate with each other and access shared resources.
