            <h3>DESIGNED A HUB & SPOKE ARCHITECTURE IN AZURE</h3>
            <p> 
                A Hub-and-Spoke architecture is a common networking design pattern used in Azure and other cloud platforms to create a scalable, 
                efficient, and well-organized network infrastructure. In this architecture, a central hub serves as a primary point of connectivity 
                and control, while multiple spokes connect to the hub to communicate with each other and access shared resources.
            </p>

            <h3>DEPLOY A VIRTUAL MACHINE SCALE SET BEHIND A LOAD BALANCER</h3>
            <p>
                Deploying a virtual machine scale set behind a load balancer in Azure represents a pivotal strategy for building highly available,
                scalable, and efficient cloud-based applications. Azure's robust infrastructure and services provide the tools necessary to architect
                your application for maximum reliability and performance. In this context,a virtual machine scale set acts as a dynamic group of 
                identically configured virtual machines, while the load balancer evenly distributes incoming network traffic across these instances.

                Load Balancer with Bastion in Azure is a networking configuration that combines Azure Load Balancer and Azure Bastion to enhance 
                the security and accessibility of virtual machines (VMs) and resources within an Azure virtual network (VNet). This configuration is 
                particularly valuable for organizations that need to provide secure remote access to VMs while distributing incoming network
                traffic across multiple VM instances
